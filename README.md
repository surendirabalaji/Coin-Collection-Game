# Coin Collection Game - Unity

## Project Overview

This project is a simple yet engaging coin collection game developed using **Unity**. In this game, players control a ball that navigates through a colorful environment, collecting coins while avoiding obstacles. The objective is to collect as many coins as possible within a given time limit, enhancing the player's reflexes and coordination.

## Features

### 1. Game Mechanics
- **Ball Control:** Players can control the ball's movement using keyboard (PC) or touch controls (mobile), allowing for intuitive navigation through the game environment.
- **Coin Collection:** Coins are scattered throughout the level, and players must roll over them to collect points. Each coin collected adds to the player's score.

### 2. Game Environment
- **3D Environment:** Created a vibrant and immersive 3D environment with various obstacles and collectibles, enhancing the visual appeal and gameplay experience.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Implemented dynamic lighting to create an engaging atmosphere that highlights the game elements.

### 3. Scoring System
- **Score Tracking:** The game tracks the number of coins collected and displays the score in real time on the user interface.
- **End of Game Screen:** Upon completing the level or running out of time, players are presented with their total score and the option to restart or exit the game.

### 4. User Interface
- **HUD Elements:** Designed a simple and user-friendly interface that shows the score, remaining time, and game controls.
- **Responsive Design:** The UI adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across PC and mobile devices.

## Project Implementation

### Tools & Technologies
- **Unity 3D**: Used as the primary development environment for creating the game.
- **C# Scripting**: Implemented game logic, player controls, and scoring using C# scripts in Unity.

### How It Works
1. **Ball Control**: The player controls the ball using either the arrow keys or touch gestures, navigating the ball through the game world.
2. **Coin Generation**: Coins are spawned at random locations in the environment, encouraging exploration and strategic movement.
3. **Collision Detection**: When the ball collides with a coin, the coin is collected, and the score is updated.
4. **Game Over Condition**: The game ends when the time runs out, displaying the final score and options for the player.

### System Requirements
- **Device Requirements**: 
  - For PC: A computer capable of running Unity (Windows, macOS).
  - For Mobile: Android or iOS devices with support for Unity apps.
- **Software Requirements**: Unity 3D (2019 or later).

## Use Cases
- **Game Development Learning**: This project serves as an introduction to game development concepts such as player control, scoring systems, and UI design.
- **Prototype Development**: The game can be expanded with additional features, levels, or power-ups to create a more comprehensive gaming experience.

## Future Enhancements
- **Levels and Challenges**: Introduce multiple levels with increasing difficulty and different layouts to keep players engaged.
- **Power-Ups**: Add power-ups that temporarily enhance the player's abilities, such as speed boosts or coin multipliers.
- **Sound Effects and Music**: Incorporate background music and sound effects to enhance the overall gaming experience.
